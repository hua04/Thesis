  starterConvo:
  - Ridiculous.
  - Nevermind that, I need for it to be done today.
  - There were some other files I needed done ASAP as well.
  - I will send the Q1 file first.
  - It'll be waiting for you within your work portal.
  - I will send more once you're done.
  - Get on with it, there's no time to waste.
