Noxx: Back already?
-> Yup, let’s get back to it!
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteJoy">>
	Noxx: I like your enthusiasm, let’s go!
-> Yeah, how are you holding up?
	Noxx: I’m all good, you don’t need to worry about me!
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteJoy">>
	Noxx: A little break was just what I needed, and now I’m ready to go!
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
<i> The two of you set off deeper into the forest with a renewed burst of energy</i>
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
Noxx: Soooo, can I hear more about what’s been keeping you so busy these days?
-> “I don’t really wanna talk about that now”
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
	Noxx: I getcha, seems stressful, whatever it is,
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
	Noxx: I hope you’re taking care of yourself though
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWink">>
	Noxx: No working yourself into the ground on my watch
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
	<i> The two of you continue in a comfortable relative silence, with Noxx pointing out interesting pieces of scenery every so often </i>
-> “Its not really anything interesting”
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteJoy">>
	Noxx: I don’t mind! I just want to hear about how you’ve been doing.
	-> “I’d rather not”
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
		<i> Noxx nods understandingly, taking your answer in stride</i>
		Noxx: Gotcha!
		<i> The two of you continue in a comfortable relative silence, with Noxx pointing out interesting pieces of scenery every so often </i>
	-> “The company I work for...”
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteDisappointed">>
		<i> You fill Noxx in, telling them about the copious amounts of paperwork you’re assigned and the flurry of demanding messages you’re buried under on a daily basis</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteConfused">>
		Noxx: So what does this company of yours do?
		-> “I don’t really know”
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAlarmed">>
			<i>Noxx blinks at you in surprise </i>
			Noxx: Really?
			-> “I don’t really care enough to involve myself in more than I need to.”
				<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
				Noxx: I see
			-> “ I pretty much only get the info I need to know, everything else is kind of a mystery.”
				Noxx: Aren’t you curious though?
				-> “It hadn’t really occurred to me before.
					<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
					Noxx: Interesting.
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWorried">>
		Noxx: It doesn’t really sound like you enjoy this work that much
		-> “I don’t, really”
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
			Noxx: That’s unfortunate…
		-> “Well, it pays reasonably"
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
			Noxx: That makes sense.
		-> “I’ve never really considered work something to ‘enjoy’”
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
			<i> Noxx’s face falls at your admission</i>
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWorried">>
			Noxx: That’s a disappointing way to live...
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		Noxx: Have you ever considered trying to find other work?
		-> “It’s too much trouble, I don’t have time to look for other options”
		-> “I don’t like the uncertainty of being between jobs, I’d rather just stay where I am”
		-> “I’ve worked so hard to get to where I am, it feels like it would be a waste”
		<i>Noxx nods, mulling over your words</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWorried">>
		Noxx: That does make sense.
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		Noxx: ...But it really doesn’t seem like this is the best path for you.
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
		Noxx: The immediate aftermath may be intimidating, but years down the line you might look back on it as the best decision you’ve ever made.
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		<i> Noxx shrugs</i>
		Noxx: -Or not, and that’s what makes it hard.
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
		Noxx: But in my mind at least, knowing you at least tried is still better than wondering what could have been.
		-> “I see what you mean”
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteJoy">>
			<i> Noxx hums affirmatively</i>
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
			Noxx: Of course it’s all easier said than done.
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
			Noxx: But I don’t think I’d be able to live my life in complacency.
			Noxx: Even if it means having to suffer to get to higher ground.
		-> “I don’t think I’m in a position to feel that way.”
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWorried">>
			<i> Noxx winces</i>
			Noxx: That might be true...
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious>>
			Noxx: Forgive me, I don’t mean to assume anything about your situation.
		-> “That sounds kind of foolish.”
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteJoy">>
			<i> Noxx barks out a laugh</i>
			<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
			Noxx: Maybe, but the fool is the start of the journey after all, isn’t it?
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteNeutral">>
<i> As the two of you continue along the path, something unusual catches your eye</i>
-> “What’s that?”
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteConfused">>
	<i> Noxx follows your gaze to figure out what you’re talking about</i>
-> “Do you know what kind of plant that is?”
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteConfused">>
	Noxx: Plant?
	<i> Noxx follows your gaze</i>
-> Point over at it
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteConfused">>
	<i> Noxx pauses and looks over to where you’re pointing </i>
Noxx: Huh...
<<switchtracks GameIcon "AdventureTension">>
<i> In the middle of a nearby clearing is an unusual amount of vines</i>
<i> But even stranger is how the vines swirl around a cross shaped structure in the center</i>
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
Noxx: That... doesn’t seem naturally occurring.
<i> Something about the cross feels ominous, and judging by the way Noxx stiffens, they get a similar feeling </i>
-> “Let’s get out of here...”
	<i> Noxx hesitates</i>
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWorried">>
	Noxx: But...”
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious>>
	Noxx: We should at least check it out, to make sure someone doesn’t need help…
	-> “No, we should leave it alone.”
		<i> Noxx seems torn, glancing between you and the cross structure.</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWorried">>
		<i> They sigh</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		Noxx: You’re right, let’s go 
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
		<i> The two of you continue on the path, enjoying an uneventful stroll</i>		
		<<fmfadeout AdjustImages>>
		<i> Before long...</i>
		<<switchtracks GameIcon "Noxx">>
		<<fmfadein AdjustImages>>
		<<wait 1>>
		<<jump SceneTwoEnd>>>
	-> “Fine... but be careful”
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
		Noxx: Of course.
-> “Do you want to take a closer look?”
	<i> Noxx nods</i>
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
	Noxx: Yeah, a quick look.
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
	Noxx: I just want to make sure everything is okay.
<i> You and Noxx slowly approach the clearing</i>
<i> The vines under your feet undulate, but they don’t make any other movement.</i>
<i> As you get within a few feet of the cross, Noxx gasps<i>
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAlarmed">>
Noxx: <b>Gods above, are you alright?!</b>
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeEyesClosed">>
<i> From this distance it becomes clear that the cross-like structure is not just vines, but seems to have a gnome wrapped in the center</i>
<i> His eyes are closed and he gives no response to Noxx’s question, but you can see his chest rise and fall with shallow breaths</i>
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAlarmed">>
<i> Face filled with panic, Noxx rushes over to the cross </i>
<<cgswitch AdjustImages "NoxxGnomeCG">>
<i> Once they are close enough, they reach out to grab at the vines entrapping the gnome</i>
???: <b> STOP!</b>
<<cgoff AdjustImages>>
<<wait 1>>
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAlarmed">>
<i> Noxx flinches backwards at the sudden sound, glancing upwards to realize the gnome had opened his eyes, glaring at them angrily</i>
<i> Noxx throws their hands up in front of them, taking a few steps back</i>
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
Noxx: I apologise, I was just trying to help.
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
<i> The gnome sneers</i>
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeYelling">>
Gnome: By sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong?! Who said I needed your help?
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
<i> The vines tighten around the gnome, leaving him wheezing for air</i>
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeYelling">>
Gnome: You see?! You’re only making it worse!
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
Noxx: Then how can we help?
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeYelling">>
Gnome: Didn’t you hear me?! I don’t need your help!
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
Gnome: You adventurers and your ego, galavanting around like you’re better than everyone else.
Gnome: Well guess what! I’ve got this under control
<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
<i> Noxx looks like they’re at a loss, so you decide to step in </i>
-> “Do you want to stay in there?”
	<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
	<i> The gnome laughs mockingly</i>
	Gnome: Of course not, you idiot!
	Gnome: Who in their right mind would want to stay trapped like this.
	<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeYelling">>
	Gnome: But I can leave whenever I want, so cease your damn meddling!
	<i> You turn to Noxx</i>
		-> “We should go”
		<<jump Leaving>>
-> “How’d you get in there in the first place?”
	<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
	<i> The gnome sneers at your words</i>
	Gnome: None of your damn business!
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteIrritated">>
	Noxx: Hey! Don’t talk to them like that.
	-> “This is going nowhere, let’s go”
		<<jump Leaving>>
-> “We’ll be on our way then.”
	<<jump Leaving>>

<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAlarmed">>
<i> Noxx whips their head around to balk at you</i>
Noxx: We can’t just leave him here!
<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeYelling">>
Gnome: You better, if you know what’s good for you!
-> “He doesn’t want to be helped”
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteScared">>
	Noxx: He can’t survive like this!
	-> It’s not our call to make
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		<i>Noxx stares at you in disbelief, before lowering their head with a sigh</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteDisappointed">>
		Noxx: You’re right.
		<i> Turning back to the Gnome, Noxx bids him farewell</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxuous">>
		Noxx: Please take care of yourself.
		<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
		<i> In return, the Gnome spits at their feet </i>
		Gnome: Good riddance, hurry up and get out!
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		<i> The two of you head out of the clearing, returning back to the path you were on</i>
		<<jump AfterGnomeNoAttempt>>
-> “He’s an ass, why should we help him?”
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAngry">>
	Noxx: What on earth do you mean, ‘why should we help him?’!
	Noxx: Is your goodwill really so conditional?!
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteIrritated">>
	<i> They pause, staring at you in disbelief</i>
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteDisappointed">>
	Noxx: I might have misjudged you.
	-> “Noxx...”
	-> “That’s not what I meant!”
	<<cgswitch AdjustImages "NoxxGnomeCG">>
	<i>Ignoring you, Noxx mutters something under their breath, reaching for the vines.</i>
	<i> Reacting to their touch, the vines loosen, allowing the gnome enough room to wriggle free</i>
	<<cgoff AdjustImages>>
	<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeYelling">>
	Gnome: Piss off! I told you to leave me alone!
	<i> Rather than taking the opportunity to run, the angry gnome turns red in the face, screaming at Noxx</i>
	Gnome: You think you’re better than me or something? You bastard! You high and mighty adventurers are all the same.
	<<spriteoff SpriteChange>>
	<<stop GameIcon>>
	<i> The vines shake off their momentary haze, tightening its grip around the gnome, and reaching for Noxx! </i>
	<<switchtracks GameIcon "AdventureDanger">>
	-> “Noxx!”
		<<spriteon SpriteChange>>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAlarmed">>
		<i> Noxx turns at the sound of your voice</i>
		<i> Seeing the vine, reaching for them, they jump into action</i>
		<i> Hands outstretched in front of them, they speak in a garbled tongue</i>
		<i> The vines turn limp once again, falling to the ground</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteScared">>
		Noxx: RUN!
		<<stop GameIcon>>
		<i> Grabbing your hand, they bolt towards the path that you two had originally been on </i>
		<<jump AfterGnomeAttempt>>
	-> Reach for your dagger
		<<spriteon SpriteChange>>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteScared">>
		<i> The vines wrap themselves around Noxx’s waist, eliciting a choked gasp as their midsection is constricted</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
		Gnome: You see! You just made it worse!
		<i> Sounding oddly triumphant for someone who has just missed an escape, the gnome gleefully watches as the vines constrict around the both of them</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "GnomeAngry">>
		Gnome: Now you’re trapped here with me, you utter buffoon!
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteScared">>
		<i> As Noxx struggles against the vine, you jump forward and slash through the base of it.</i>
		<i> As the vine falls limp around Noxx, you grab their hand</i>
		-> “RUN!”
		<i> You bolt off towards the path the two of you were originally on, dragging Noxx after you</i>
		<<stop GameIcon>>

<i> Once back on the path, the two of you fall into a heavy silence </i>

<i> Noxx’s tail droops, their eyes distant</i>

	<i> You figure that prying would do more harm than good</i>
	<i> You give them the space to sort through their thoughts at their own pace, figuring they would share them with you when you were ready</i>

	<i> They leave the end of their sentence unspoken, shoulders sagging</i>

		<i> Noxx sighs, sagging next to you</i>
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		Noxx: Yeah... I know.
		Noxx: But I still feel like I should have tried harder.
	-> “It’s not your responsibility to help.”
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteAnxious">>
		Noxx: Imagine if every person felt that way about the people around them.
		<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteWorried">>
		<i> They sigh</i>
		Noxx: I know I’m not obligated, but it’s just nice to imagine a world where people would try regardless.
	-> “You did your best.”
		Noxx: True... it’s just disappointing to know your best wasn’t good enough.
	<i> They pause, straightening up and squaring their shoulders</i>
	<<expr SpriteChange "NoxxSpriteHappy">>
